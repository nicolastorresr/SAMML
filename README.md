# SAMML: Socially Adaptive Multi-Modal Learning Framework

The Socially Adaptive Multi-Modal Learning (SAMML) framework simulates human-like learning and social dynamics in artificial social networks. This repository provides tools to study network formation, influencer dynamics, and information propagation.

## Features
- Multi-modal input processing (text, images, audio)
- Dynamic social adaptation using reinforcement learning
- Contextual memory for episodic and semantic learning
- Simulation of large-scale artificial social networks
