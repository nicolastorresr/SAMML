Module: multi_modal.py

Description:
This module implements the processing of multi-modal inputs (text, images, and audio) 
using pre-trained models. It includes pipelines for feature extraction and the integration 
of multiple signals into a unified representation for agents to process.

Dependencies:
- transformers: For processing text using pre-trained language models.
- torchvision: For processing image data.
- numpy: For numerical operations on extracted features.
- utils: For loading and pre-processing raw data inputs.
