Module: social_adaptation.py

Description:
This module implements the social adaptation mechanism, enabling agents to update their 
behavior based on interactions and rewards from other agents. It uses reinforcement 
learning techniques to optimize agent policies over time.

Dependencies:
- gym: For creating reinforcement learning environments.
- torch: For implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
- agent: For accessing agent states and performing policy updates.
